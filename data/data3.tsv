SZO	Schizophrenia	GSE27383	OK	Raw intensities values of all samples were normalized by RMA normalization (Robust Multichip Analysis) (background correction and quantile normalization) using Partek version 6.4 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). To visualize the clustering of the samples, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used.

A06 and A18 were excluded due to outlying global signal intensities.	54675	72	GPL570	DONE	1	10
SZO	Schizophrenia	GSE37981	quantile normalized	Each array was scanned twice and the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.1 software averaged the two images to compute an intensity value for each probe cell within each probe set. For the quality control step, we employed the dChip and Partek® software’s built-in function (Copyright, Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). We then normalized all data with Partek’s standard normalization method (i.e. data has a mean of zero and a variance of one, and each column for each sample was divided by the average of all control samples). After a principal component analysis revealed the contribution of batch effect (scan date) to the observed variance, an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with diagnosis and batch effect as covariates and the false discovery rate set at 10%. Differentially expressed genes were visualized by performing unsupervised hierarchical clustering as stringency of the filtering criteria (i.e. fold-change and p-value) was being varied to determine a representative gene list for pathway analyses. We employed three approaches to explore the biological significance of our expression data. First, differentially expressed genes were manually grouped to elucidate gene families that appeared to be dysregulated in schizophrenia. Second, pathway analyses were performed with two web-based algorithms, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems) and MetaCore from GeneGo Inc. to map the differentially expressed genes onto biological functions and canonical pathways. With Ingenuity, the significance for each of the identified pathways was determined via a Fisher’s exact test, whereas GeneGo makes use of their algorithm for hypergeometric distribution, identifying pathways overrepresented with significant genes. Third, literature mining was performed to elucidate which of these pathways or gene families might be particularly pertinent for pyramidal neuronal functions and dendritic/synaptic architecture and plasticity. We also made note of differentially expressed genes that have been implicated as schizophrenia risk genes.	61359	18	GPL1352	DONE	2	1

Data were filtered to exclude those transcripts that were not present in at least one of the RNA samples, those with redundant probeset IDs (retaining those with the highest p-value for hybridization) and those showing the lowest variation; a list of 14,438 probesets remained for statistical testing.
